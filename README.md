# Computer-Vision-Course
In this repository, I have included my exercises from the computer vision course. There are six Jupyter notebooks covering topics such as "Fundamentals of Pictures," "Contrast Adjustment," "Frequency Domain," "Wavelet," "Colors," and "Features." The Problem Text are [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/HW.pdf).
 ## Image Fandamentals
 In this exercise I have worked on quantization and iterpolation for pictures. The related jupyter notebook is in these three links: [URL1](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/Image_Fundemental1.1.1.ipynb), [URL2](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/image_fundemental1.1.2.ipynb) and [URL3](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/Image_Fundemental_1.1.3.ipynb) . 
 ## Contrast Adjustment
  In this exercise I have worked on Histograms and local and global histogram equalization and the codes are in this [URL](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Contrast%20Adjustment/Assignmnet2.ipynb).

 ## Frequency Domain
   In this exercise I have worked on Frequency domain and a variety of filters such as Gussien, Laplasian, DFT, IDFT and transforms. The codes are [URL](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Frequency_Domain/Untitled.ipynb).
  ## Wawelet
   In this exercise I have worked on a variet of pyramids. The codes are [URL](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Wavelet/Untitled.ipynb).

   ## Colors
   Working with color space includin HSI, RGB and quantized have been done in this exercise and its codes are [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Colors/Untitled.ipynb).
   ## Features
   In this exercise i have worked on Harris corner detector, SURF and SIFT. The codes are [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Features/Untitled.ipynb).
