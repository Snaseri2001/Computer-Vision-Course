# Computer-Vision-Course
In this repository, I have included my exercises from the computer vision course. There are six Jupyter notebooks covering topics such as "Fundamentals of Pictures," "Contrast Adjustment," "Frequency Domain," "Wavelet," "Colors," and "Features." The Problem Text are [here](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/HW.pdf).
 ## Image Fandamentals
 In this exercise I have worked on quantization and iterpolation for pictures. The related jupyter notebook is in these three links: [URL1](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/Image_Fundemental1.1.1.ipynb), [URL2](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/image_fundemental1.1.2.ipynb) and [URL3](https://github.com/Snaseri2001/Computer-Vision-Course/blob/main/Image%20Fundamentals/Image_Fundemental_1.1.3.ipynb) . 
 ## Contrast Adjustment
